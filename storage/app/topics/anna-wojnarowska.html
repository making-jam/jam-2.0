<p>Placing people at the heart of government department projects has led to innovative ways of bringing about change in
    the public sector.</p>

<p>In her talk, Anna will show how the Government Digitial Service (GDS) uses ethnographic research methods to
    understand people's motivations, daily problems and what they need to do to get their job done. This method allows
    them to identify the biggest opportunities for change, and whether they are technology, service or policy-driven.
    Anna will tell you all about how you can do the same to understand your users and build the things they want.</p>
