<p>From its very beginning YPlan positioned itself as a curated events' platform, catering to those looking to discover
    hidden gems that London, New York and other metropolises have to offer. Such premise was applauded and raved about
    by the customers in focus groups and app reviews.</p>

    you have best deals for cinema, 50 Cent's gig at O2 and Sunset Safari at London Zoo. In other words, customers want
    bizarre and unorthodox, however they buy mainstream names and big discounts. How to address such divergence in the
    product's perception and the reality that generates the revenue without loosing your cool and the trust of
    users?</p>

    beliefs and their pragmatic needs.</p>
