<h2>Manifesto</h2>

<p>Building products is hard. When the three of us started working
	together at <a href="http://www.adbrain.com" target="_blank">Adbrain</a> a year ago, we struggled. We’d
	worked on products before, but nothing quite like this (ad tech
	products are complicated). How do you decide what to build? How do
	designers, engineers and product managers seamlessly work together?
	What tools are best for the job at hand? How does a good product
	become great?</p>

<p>We often wondered how other companies went about building products
	from scratch. We realised what we really needed was a place where we
	could learn from others that have been there and done it. Somewhere
	where we could discover and understand how all the parts fit
	together.</p>

<p>So we decided to start JAM. This is the community we wish we’d had
	all along, a place where people, across all disciplines can discuss
	their successes and failures, experiments, tools and techniques, and
	anything else that gets great products built.</p>

<p>We hope you’ll join us.</p>
