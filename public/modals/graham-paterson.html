<p>Graham works on Product at TransferWise, the international money transfer platform.</p>

<p>TransferWise helps customers send money abroad at a lower cost than ever before. It uses technology to cut out all
	the hidden fees banks and brokers charge. The platform is growing fast: its customers have already used it to move
	over £3bn, and it’s attracted $91m from investors such as world’s largest VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, Sir Richard
	Branson, Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, the co-founders of PayPal.</p>

<p>Prior to starting TransferWise, Graham released NightCapp, an iOS and Android app that lets you know which bars
	around you are still open. He also worked as a freelance designer and developer for companies around the tech startup
	scene.</p>

<p>At TransferWise, Graham looks after the Transfer Experience, using big(ish) data insights to influence emotional
	behaviour in customers.</p>
